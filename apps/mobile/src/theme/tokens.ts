/**
 * The design system, as typed tokens.
 *
 * SPEC-ui.md §4. This is the ONLY file in the app allowed to contain a hex
 * colour — an ESLint rule enforces it. That is not tidiness: a hardcoded colour
 * is a colour that silently ignores dark mode and never gets contrast-checked.
 *
 * THE COLOUR RULE THAT MATTERS MOST:
 *
 *   Red is reserved for SAFETY warnings only. Never for food, never for a missed
 *   goal, never for a number being "bad".
 *
 * The app we are replacing reuses one coral hue for both "protein" and "you
 * missed your goal", which turns a food-group identity colour into a shame
 * signal. Uncertainty here is VIOLET — an invitation to check, not a scold.
 * A scolding colour is what makes people switch the indicator off, which defeats
 * the entire point of having one.
