/**
 * Onboarding answers.
 *
 * EVERY FIELD HERE HAS A CONSUMER. That is the rule this file is written against.
 *
 * The app we are cloning asks several questions purely to manufacture
 * psychological investment before a paywall — the research corpus is explicit
 * that "what's stopping you" and "what would you like to accomplish" exist to
 * raise conversion, not to change the product. We have no paywall, so an
 * unanswered-for-no-reason question would be pure interrogation.
 *
 * So each of those screens is kept for UX parity AND given a real job:
 *
 *   sex, birthYear, heightCm, weightKg   -> Mifflin-St Jeor, directly
 *   workoutsPerWeek                      -> the activity multiplier
 *   goal, desiredWeightKg                -> deficit direction and rate
 *   dietStyle                            -> RESOLVER BIAS. A vegan's scan should
 *                                           not resolve to a beef row, and the
 *                                           oil/milk assumption-filler defaults
 *                                           change with the diet.
 *   blocker                              -> which retention surfaces default ON
 *   accomplish                           -> what the Today screen leads with
 *   worksWithProfessional                -> suppresses coaching nudges and turns
 *                                           on the dietitian-friendly PDF export
 *   rolloverCalories                     -> a real daily-target behaviour
 *
 * If a field is ever added here without a consumer, delete the screen instead.
